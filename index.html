            <p>Hello! My name is Kioni Pablo and I am originally from the island of Guam! I have been living in Seattle
                for about three and a half years. Prior to living in Seattle, I was living in San Diego and was there for four
                and a half years. During my time in San Diego, I was attending the University of San Diego where I received my Bachelor's Degree
                in Accounting. As soon as I graduated from the University of San Diego, I relocated to Seattle where I worked as an Accountant
                at a company called SSA Marine for 2 years. After my time at SSA Marine, I found a job as an Accountant at Zillow where I currently
                am at now.
            </p>

            <p> Currently, I am looking to transition my career to Software Engineering. I would like to use my Accounting background to 
                get into a Software Engineering position that focuses on the development of 
                Financial Applications.
            </p>

            <p>Outside of working at Zillow and furthering my knowledge in coding at the University of Washington, I actively train and compete in the 
                sport of Jui Jitsu at Gracie Barra (Seattle). I love to travel to new places, experience different cultures, and try new
                foods. So far I have been to Greece, Thailand, Japan, Philippines, and several different
                states in the U.S.
